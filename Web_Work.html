        <h4>The first website I ever created using HTML and CSS was called Chronoshift which is about a book we read, Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder” about a time traveling company that went back in time that caused a butterfly effect. The pages included information about the rules, what the companies are about, and how to register. Also showed how we used the past lesson in the site and seeing how much we can do on our own.

        The instructions told us to use Figma to help design the site, so we had an idea of what we wanted, and by using CSS, we programmed the color and layout for the website. By using CSS, we had to figure out how to properly layout images and using Photoshop we got the images to the best quality. Also, using Html we got the text and images but also made a navigation bar which was a good starting point on learning how to start making websites. Furthermore, by using Figma, we got to see how we want to put images and see how it would turn out if we coded it properly.
            
        I was excited to code my very first website, but it was very difficult because I didn’t fully understand how to start coding my Figma layout or how to make it look professional. This showed me the CART Habit of Mind I learned was communication because by talking to other students that had good sites and knew what they were doing, it was easier for me to understand;, without other’s help I probably would have failed. Another Habit of Mind I used was “Persistence”because since it was my very first time coding a website using HTML and CSS, I had many times where I thought about giving up.

        <h4>The first group website I made was called the Tourism website which talks about different countries of choice and why the user should visit them. The goal of the website was to get the user interested in the website and try to make it seem professional. The software that we used was html and css to make the website’s layout and design and using figma to get a prototype of the website layout.
        By using CSS we had to figure out how to make the navigation bar work and look professional, and try to make the images look good with quality and size. Also, we had to find information about each country and how much it cost for flights and what tourist attractions they are, so they can get interested. Then by using CSS we were able to make a make so when clicks on a destination it goes to the page with all of the information.
        Since it was my first group website project we had problems with each person participating and helping each other with the code. The things I learned from the CART Habits of Mind was collaboration and communication. When it comes to collaborating I’m not really the best at it because I like working alone and not knowing how to work with others. Also, when it comes to communicating I don’t because I feel like I ask for help I am stupid. But by following these habits of mind my team and I were able to finish the project very well.

        <h4>Another group project I did was called the “Interactive Story”, the goal was to make a story where the user can decide where it goes. We used everything we learned this semester about Html, CSS, Javascript to make this. The program uses branches from a flowchart we made and used buttons to give the user a decision to make. By using a flowchart we could get an idea where the story can go and how we want each branch to be like, and by making a program flowchart we can make units for what we are going to code.

        The theme of the story was escape and survive, basically the story is for the user to escape without consequences or if they get caught they have to figure how to keep things calm or under control. One difficulty was trying to make the buttons work to wear when the user clicks on the button, more of the story pops up and the buttons change as the story continues but if they come to an ending they go back to the intro of the game.
            
        I became frustrated with this because it wasn’t working for some reason. However, I was excited to create my own interactive game for the first time and wanted to finish it. One of the CART Habits of Mind I took into this was persistence. In addition, doing this as a group showed me the value of communication because we have to be on the same page to finish the project.

        <h4>The first JavaScript project is called the “Calculator”;, the goal of this project is to make a calculator website. We Use JavaScript to make the buttons with numbers 0-9 and put different mathematical signs. Basically make our own phone calculator that we can change the design with CSS.

        When it came to this project it was very frustrating because the buttons weren’t working with calculating numbers.. I learned the importance of the CART Habit of Mind “Persistence.”  In addition, using JavaScript to create my calculator showed me the importance of communication with my peers and instructors. Without their help and encouragement, I may not have persisted and taken a low score.
